# OrbitHost Fallback System

## Overview

The OrbitHost Fallback System ensures that content deployed through the "hey post this to orbithost.dev" command is always available, even during outages or high-traffic periods. This document explains how the fallback system works and how it's integrated with AI deployments.

## Key Features

- **5 Free Fallbacks**: Every user gets 5 free fallback deployments
- **Unlimited Fallbacks for Paid Plans**: Upgrade for unlimited fallback protection
- **Automatic Registration**: All AI deployments are automatically registered with the fallback service
- **Simplified Content Versions**: Fallbacks are optimized for fast loading during outages
- **Seamless Redirection**: Users are automatically redirected to fallbacks when needed

## How It Works

### Deployment Process

1. When content is deployed via the "hey post this to orbithost.dev" command, the primary deployment is created on orbithost.dev
2. Simultaneously, a simplified version of the content is created on the fallback service
3. Both URLs are returned in the API response
4. The user receives both the primary URL and fallback URL

### Fallback Activation

If the primary deployment becomes unavailable:

1. The OrbitHost system detects the outage
2. Users attempting to access the primary URL are automatically redirected to the fallback URL
3. The fallback version is served until the primary deployment is restored
4. The transition is seamless for end users

## Technical Implementation

### Fallback Architecture

The fallback system uses a dual deployment approach:

1. **Component-Level Fallback**: Integrated within the OrbitHost production environment
2. **Environment-Level Fallback**: Deployed as a separate application on the hosting service

This provides layered resilience:
- Component failures are handled by the integrated fallback
- Environment failures are handled by the separately deployed fallback

### Fallback URLs

Fallback URLs follow this pattern:
```
https://fallback.orbithost.dev/{subdomain}
```

Where `{subdomain}` is the same as the primary deployment subdomain.

## Quota System

### Free Tier

- 5 free fallbacks per user
- When quota is exceeded, new deployments will not have fallback protection
- Existing fallbacks remain active

### Paid Tiers

- Unlimited fallbacks
- Priority fallback service
- Advanced fallback analytics

## API Integration

When deploying content via the AI Deployment API, the response includes fallback information:

```json
{
  "message": "Deployment created successfully",
  "url": "https://your-content-abc123.orbithost.dev",
  "fallback": {
    "available": true,
    "url": "https://fallback.orbithost.dev/your-content-abc123",
    "quotaExceeded": false,
    "upgradeMessage": null
  }
}
```

If the user has exceeded their fallback quota:

```json
{
  "message": "Deployment created successfully",
  "url": "https://your-content-abc123.orbithost.dev",
  "fallback": {
    "available": false,
    "url": null,
    "quotaExceeded": true,
    "upgradeMessage": "You've used all 5 free fallbacks. Upgrade for unlimited fallbacks."
  }
}
```

## For AI Assistants

When helping users deploy content to OrbitHost, AI assistants should:

1. Inform users about the fallback protection (5 free fallbacks)
2. Explain that fallbacks ensure their content is always available
3. If the API response indicates the quota is exceeded, suggest upgrading for more fallbacks
4. Include both the primary URL and fallback URL (if available) when providing deployment results

### Example Response for Users

When a user deploys content and fallback is available:

"Your content has been deployed to [primary URL]. It's also protected by our fallback system at [fallback URL], ensuring 99.99% uptime. You have [X] fallbacks remaining out of your 5 free fallbacks."

When a user has exceeded their fallback quota:

"Your content has been deployed to [primary URL]. You've used all 5 free fallbacks. To ensure your content is always available, consider upgrading for unlimited fallbacks."

## Monitoring and Analytics

Users can monitor their fallback usage and performance in the OrbitHost dashboard:

1. Log in to https://orbithost.dev/dashboard
2. Navigate to "Fallback Protection"
3. View fallback usage, quota, and performance metrics

## Upgrading for More Fallbacks

To upgrade from the free tier to unlimited fallbacks:

1. Log in to https://orbithost.dev/dashboard
2. Click "Upgrade Plan"
3. Select a plan with unlimited fallbacks
4. Complete the payment process
